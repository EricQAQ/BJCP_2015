  <section level="1" title="Introduction to Beer Styles">
    <paragraph>*In order to reduce the size of style descriptions, we use some basic shorthand or jargon to represent more complex thoughts, and we also omit some items that should only be noted in exception circumstances. Some terminology may have different meanings in certain parts of the world, so we define our usages to avoid confusion. We also identify certain characteristics that are assumed not to be present in all beer styles so we don't have to repeat those restrictions in every style.*</paragraph>
    <section level="2" title="Basic Categorization">
      <paragraph>The most general categorization of beer styles by yeast type is a modern craft brewing phenomenon. American brewers and most other craft brewers call beers *ales* if they use top-fermenting (ale) yeast and *lagers* if they use bottom-fermenting (lager) yeast. Most categorization systems will allow for a third classification, often called spontaneously-fermented because of the method; however, *wild* is perhaps a more widely-used modern craft beer term for these beers fermented with bacteria or non-saccharomyces yeast. The term *wild* in this context does not imply spontaneous fermentation; most are directly inoculated with the desired fermentation strains.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>In Germany and other old world brewing centers, the terminology most typically used to differentiate beers is to refer to them as *top-fermenting* or *bottom-fermenting*. Germans think of ale as a type of English beer, and lager as a method of conditioning beer. So Germans would typically speak of Kölsch as a top-fermenting lager beer, not an ale.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>English brewers, particularly when dealing in a historical context, might separate ales from porters and stouts as types of beer (although in the next breath, saying there is no difference between porters and stouts). When dealing in even more historical contexts, they might go even further to describe ale as distinct from beer in that beer was hopped (or more highly hopped) than ale. These historical notes are important for understanding old recipes and writings, but have little relevance today in the common usages of terms describing beer.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>These guidelines attempt to use the modern craft beer definitions of *ale*, *lager*, and *wild* as the major groupings of beer styles, but will mention how they might be described in local or regional contexts, if possible.</paragraph>
    </section>
    <section level="2" title="Common Attributes of All Beer Styles">
      <paragraph>The attributes discussed in this section are assumed to be present in every beer style description unless otherwise noted. It is not necessary to repeat all these characteristics for every style description. *Do not assume that since a characteristic (such as diacetyl) isn't mentioned in a style description that somehow it is allowable.*</paragraph>
      <paragraph>**Unless explicitly noted in an individual style description**, all beer styles are assumed to be cleanly fermented and free from technical faults, including acetaldehyde, astringency, chlorophenols, diacetyl, DMS, fusel alcohol, and phenolics. All beer styles are assumed to be free of packaging and handling faults, including oxidation, light-struck, sour, and musty characteristics.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>In mouthfeel, all beers are assumed to be free from astringency, and not be creamy or have any other palate sensations unless otherwise noted. Beers with an alcohol level of 6% or less are assumed to not have the flavor or warming nature of alcohol, unless otherwise noted. Higher-alcohol beers that have a noticeable alcohol presence should not be harsh, hot, solventy, or burning. The alcohol character if noted, should be clean and not have fusel alcohols.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Lagers tend to be smooth, clean, and free of esters, but may have slight yeast-derived sulfur notes that are often fleeting. Styles made with a large amount of Pilsner malt may have low DMS notes; this is not a fault, but it is also not required unless otherwise noted. In both cases, the small amounts of sulfur and/or DMS should not be taken as meaning that prominent quantities are somehow desirable -- they're not. Just be aware that the use of some traditional ingredients often leave small sensory indications of their presence that might be considered faults in other contexts; that is perfectly acceptable, although not required.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Unless otherwise noted, assume all lagers to not have any fruitiness (esters). Ales tend to be less smooth than lagers, so unless otherwise noted, assume all ales may have some esters (not required, but not a fault).</paragraph>
    </section>
    <section level="2" title="Glossary">
      <paragraph>*Some terminology used in the style guidelines may be unfamiliar to some readers. Rather than include a complete dictionary, we have highlighted a few terms that either may not be well understood, or that imply specific meanings within the guidelines. Sometimes ingredient names are used as a shorthand for the character they provide to beer. When judges use these terms, they don't necessarily imply that those specific ingredients have been used, just that the perceived characteristics match those commonly provided by the mentioned ingredients.*</paragraph>
      <section level="3" title="Hop Terms">
        <paragraph>**American hops** -- modern American brewing hops from the craft beer era, typically having citrusy, resiny, evergreen, or similar characteristics. More modern hops can add even more unusual and experimental characteristics, such as stone fruit, berry, and melon.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Old World hops** -- traditional European brewing hops, including Saazer-type hops, British brewing hops, and those other varieties from continental Europe. Typically described as floral, spicy, herbal, or earthy. Generally less intense than many New World hops.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**New World hops** -- American hops, along with those from Australia and New Zealand, and other non-Old World locations. Can have all the attributes of classic American hops, as well as tropical fruit, stone fruit, white grape, and other interesting aromatics.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Saazer-type hops** -- often called noble hops, traditionally among the finest continental European brewing hops. Often having a lightly floral, spicy, or herbal character; rarely brash and aggressive, typically more subtle and elegant in nature.</paragraph>
      </section>
      <section level="3" title="Malt or Mashing Terms">
        <paragraph>**Munich malt** -- can provide a bready, richly malty quality that enhances the malt backbone of a beer without adding residual sweetness, although some can confuse maltiness with sweetness. Darker Munich malts can add a deeply toasted malt quality similar to toasted bread crusts.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Vienna malt** -- can provide a bready-toasty malt presence, but don't expect the toasted notes to be extreme -- they're more like untoasted bread crusts than toasted bread.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Pilsner or Pils malt** -- continental Pilsner malt is quite distinctive, and has a slightly sweet, lightly grainy character with a soft, slightly toasty, honey-like quality. Higher in DMS precursors than other malts, its use can sometimes result in a low corny DMS flavor.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Maillard products** -- a class of compounds produced from complex interactions between sugars and amino acids at high temperatures, resulting in brown colors and rich, malty, sometimes even somewhat meaty compounds. In previous versions of the guidelines, known as melanoidins, which are a subset of Maillard products responsible for red-brown colors (and, according to Kunze, are “aroma-intensive”). In some brewing literature, melanoidin and Maillard product are used interchangeably. The chemistry and flavor characterization is not well understood, so brewers and judges should avoid excessively pedantic discussions around these points. The takeaway is that we mean the richly malty flavors, and need some kind of convenient shorthand to discuss them. Maillard is pronounced, roughly, as “my-YARD.”</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Biscuity** -- dry, toasted grain, flour, or dough flavor reminiscent of English digestive biscuits; in brewing, a flavor commonly associated with Biscuit malt and some traditional English malts.</paragraph>
      </section>
      <section level="3" title="Yeast or Fermentation Terms">
        <paragraph>**Clean fermentation profile** -- the quality of having very low to no yeast-derived fermentation by-products in the finished beer, typically implying that there are no esters, diacetyl, acetaldehyde, or similar components, except if specifically mentioned. A shorthand for saying that the long list of possible fermentation by-products are not present in significant or appreciable quantities (barely perceived trace quantities at the threshold of perception are typically acceptable, nonetheless).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Pome fruit** -- apple, pear, quince. The botanical classification contains other fruit, but these are the common ones we mean.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Stone fruit** -- fleshy fruit with a single pit (or stone), such as cherry, plum, peach, apricot, mango, etc.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Brett** -- shorthand term for *Brettanomyces*, an attenuative genus of yeast that often is used to produce fruity or funky complex flavors (leather, sweat, funk, etc.) in fermented beverages. Literally means “British fungus” and is often associated with qualities produced during barrel aging. Common species used in brewing include *B. bruxellensis* and *B. anomalous*, although they are sometimes known by other names; several strains exist with very different profiles (as with *S. cerevisiae*). May be used as a primary fermentation or secondary fermentation strain.</paragraph>
      </section>
      <section level="3" title="Quality or Off-Flavor Terms">
        <paragraph>**Adjunct quality** -- a characteristic of beer aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel that reflects the use of higher percentages of non-malt fermentables. Can present as a corny character, a lighter body than an all-malt product, or a generally thinner-tasting beer. Does not necessarily imply the use of any specific adjunct.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**DMS** -- Dimethyl Sulfide, which can take on a wide range of perceptual characteristics. Most are inappropriate in any style of beer; however, a light cooked corn quality may be apparent in beers with high levels of Pilsner malt. When the guidelines state that any levels of DMS are appropriate, it is this light cooked corn flavor, not other cooked vegetable characteristics or other DMS flavors.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Rustic** -- coarse, hearty, robust character reminiscent of older, traditional ingredients; perhaps less refined as a general sensory experience.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Elegant** -- smooth, tasteful, refined, pleasant character suggestive of high quality ingredients handled with care; lacking rough edges, sharp flavors, and palate-attacking sensations.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Funky** -- A positive or negative term, depending on the context. If expected or desirable, can often take on a barnyard, wet hay, slightly earthy, horse blanket, or farmyard character. If too intense, unexpected, or undesirable, can take the form of silage, fecal, baby diaper, or horse stall qualities.</paragraph>
      </section>
      <section level="3" title="Appearance Terms">
        <paragraph>**Belgian Lace (Lacing)** -- a characteristic and persistent latticework pattern of foam left on the inside of the glass as a beer is consumed. The look is reminiscent of fine lacework from Brussels or Belgium, and is a desirable indicator of beer quality in Belgium.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>**Legs** -- a pattern that a beverage leaves on the inside of a glass after a portion has been consumed. The term refers to the droplets that slowly fall in streams from beverage residue on the side of the glass. Not an indication of quality, but can indicate a higher alcohol, sugar, or glycerol content.</paragraph>

    <section level="2" title="Color Reference">
      <paragraph>*Note that SRM is a measure of beer color density more than hue/tint. Keep this in mind when attempting to use only SRM numbers when describing beers. Within these Guidelines, beer color descriptors generally follow this mapping to SRM values:*</paragraph>

    <section level="2" title="Style Organization">
      <paragraph>The beer styles described in the guidelines have been categorized to assist with running homebrew competitions. Categories (the major groupings of styles) are artificial constructs that represent a collection of individual sub-categories (beer styles) that may or may not have any historical, geographic, or traditional relationship with each other. Do not infer that membership in a style category somehow relates beer styles with each other. The only reason why they are grouped together is to assist with managing the scale and complexity of competitions. The names given to the groupings are for competition purposes only, and may not be used in any broader contexts in the beer and brewing industries.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>**Competitions do not have to judge each style category separately**; they may be combined, split, or otherwise reorganized for competition purposes. Competition organizers are free to combine style sub-categories into their own competition categories. As long as each submitted beer is judged against the identified sub-category (style), any logical grouping is permitted.</paragraph>
    </section>
    <section level="2" title="Style Tag Reference">
      <paragraph>To assist with regrouping styles for other purposes, we have added informational tags to each style. These tags indicate certain attributes of the beer that may be used for grouping purposes. The ‘meaning' column explains the general intent of the tag, but is not meant to be rigorous, formal definition. In no way do the tags supersede the actual descriptions of the style.</paragraph>
